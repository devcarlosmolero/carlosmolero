## Subscription and Payment Policy

At NovaScript LLC, subscriptions are **non-refundable** once payment has been made, regardless of the circumstances, such as early cancellations, service interruptions not attributable to us, or personal decisions not to use the service.

### Subscription Cancellation

If you wish to cancel your subscription, you must do so **at least one month before the renewal date** to avoid additional charges. Requests made within the same month as the renewal will not take effect until the following period. It is the customer's responsibility to manage these requests in advance.

### Automatic Renewals

All subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled beforehand. Keep your payment information updated to ensure uninterrupted service.

We reserve the right to update this refund and returns policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, reflecting the new update date.
